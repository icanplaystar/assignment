Section 1: Executive Summary

A1.1: Design Report

Project Title: PingPong Pathways — A Community Table Tennis Web Application for Health &
Inclusion

This project proposes a modern, accessible, and responsive web application for a Melbourne-based
not-for-profit (NFP) committed to improving community health through table tennis. Based on analysis
of successful platforms such as headspace for location-based service discovery and VicHealth for
inclusive community sport promotion, the design integrates proven engagement strategies into a
tailored solution for the client’s mission.

The client’s objectives are threefold: (1) increase participation in inclusive, low-cost community sport,
especially among retirees and older adults seeking gentle, social activity; (2) support newcomers,
including international students, to engage in welcoming, beginner-friendly activities; and (3) streamline
operations for event promotion, registration, volunteer coordination, and donations, while demonstrating
measurable impact to stakeholders.

The primary audiences are retirees and older adults who value accessible sport for health maintenance
and social connection, and young international students seeking affordable, beginner-friendly activities
to reduce stress, make friends, and adapt to life in Melbourne. Secondary audiences include volunteers,
coaches, partner venues, local councils, and donors who share the NFP’s commitment to health and
inclusion.

The application centers on two core experiences:

1.A Venue & Session Finder with suburb/postcode search, senior-friendly and beginner-friendly filters,
accessibility indicators, and integrated map-based directions, inspired by headspace’s “Find a Centre”
functionality, reducing first-visit anxiety and ensuring sessions are easy to locate.

2.An Events & Registration system with clear scheduling, capacity indicators, concession pricing, and
multilingual confirmations, streamlining participation and minimising barriers identified in VicHealth’s
community program feedback.

Supporting features include Getting Started guides for first-time players, Safety & Inclusion pages
reflecting Table Tennis Victoria’s inclusive practice statements, and Stories that showcase participant
and volunteer experiences to inspire engagement. For staff and administrators, an Admin Dashboard
tracks attendance, demographics, and satisfaction to inform program development.

Built with Vue 3, Bootstrap responsiveness, Pinia state management, and Firebase services
(Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions), the platform enables role-based access, ratings
aggregation, CSV/PDF exports, and secure communication. Accessibility adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA
standards, ensuring keyboard navigation, semantic HTML, and text alternatives for all media.

Success metrics will monitor venue searches, registrations, ratios of first-time to returning users,
retiree/student participation share, and post-session ratings. By combining research-driven design with
user-focused functionality, PingPong Pathways will serve as a trusted, inclusive entry point for diverse
community members to connect, stay active, and benefit from the mental and physical health
advantages of table tennis.

ChatGPT for
problem solving

I used ChatGPT to get feedback on my draft personas and sitemap to improve clarity
and detail so they meet the “Exceeds Expectations” standard.

ChatGPT for
brainstorming ideas

I used ChatGPT to brainstorm how to structure the Executive Summary, User
Personas, Sitemap, and Wireframes. It helped me clarify the key elements and ensure
they aligned with the assessment criteria.
